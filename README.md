### Perceptron Implementation

This repository contains a simple implementation of the Perceptron algorithm from scratch using Python. The Perceptron is one of the earliest supervised learning algorithms for binary classifiers.
The Perceptron is a type of linear classifier, and it makes its predictions based on a linear predictor function combining a set of weights with the feature vector. This project aims to provide an educational implementation to help understand how the Perceptron works.
